    <p>Go ahead fellow citizens of the boot, hate away, but I've heard nothing but the occasional clink of the bowl and
      a quiet inquiry about second servings after I've served this to some of my favorite people. If you want this to be
      primo perfect flavor, you'll want to set aside at least 8 hours total to prep proper and really be set up for
      success.</p>
    <p>Why call it secret socialist gumbo? Well, that's the theme for 2020, right? Call things what they're not just to
      make people mad? Too much edge for a recipe? No worries, it's mainly just a jab at family who think my borderline
      zealotry for education makes me a socialist. If anything, it's a great excuse to drink a beer or 6 and stir
      something while you watch the impending apocalypse through your kitchen window.</p>
    <p>For the record: <b>all of these are approximate measurements!</b> Feel free to tweak this after the first make,
      and please be sure to tell me about every time you do! This can definitely be better but I know for a <b>fact</b>
      this is a great place to start.</p>
    <h3>things you'll need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 quart stock pot</li>
      <li>wooden paddle spoon (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/OXO-1058020-Wooden-Nonstick-Cookware/dp/B0000CCY1M">like
          this</a>)</li>
      <li>some bowls to set things in, probably like 3 medium ones would work</li>
      <li>If cooking on gas is an option, it makes heat management easier when cooking the roux.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> ~1/3 cup unbleached flour</li>
      <li> ~1/3 cup olive oil</li>
      <li> 2 boxes of chicken stock (what you normally find in a grocery store)</li>
      <li> one large white onion</li>
      <li> 1 bell pepper of each color</li>
      <li> couple stalks green onion</li>
      <li> bunch(?) of celery (basically what they have available in the produce section that's rubber banded together.
        The bag that's "snack prepared" with like, 15-20 sticks in there works perfect for this.)</li>
      <li> 2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li> 1 jalapeno</li>
      <li> fresh parsley </li>
      <li> pack of andouille sausage (usually comes in a pack of 3)</li>
      <li> small pack of boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li> small pack of boneless chicken thigh</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>optional secret ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>glass of white wine if you have on hand</li>
      <li>2 tsp of file (dried and finely ground sassafras leaf)</li>
      <li>a cheap beer you're not afraid to drink shamelessly</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>prep stuffs</h3>
    <p>This is usually done best the night before so you're not completely over cooking by the time you <i>actually</i>
      start prepping.</p>
    <p>Take chicken and lightly coat with cajun seasoning (Tony's, Slap ya Mama, something like that.) Cover/Ziplock
      chicken and put in fridge for later. Slice the andouille into small circles and also set aside. Cube all the
      vegetables and dice the
      jalapeno and set aside. I probably should have told you that this is what the 3 bowls are for first.</p>
    <h3>the most important part: the roux</h3>
    <p>In a heavy stock pot, heat a small portion of the olive oil to medium-high heat. Cook the sausage and one clove
      of garlic in this oil and take the sausage out, leaving just the oil and what the sausage left behind. Add the
      rest of
      the oil and bring to heat. Slowly add the flour, constantly stirring to evenly spread the flour throughout the
      oil. <span class="warning">Constant stirring is very, very, VERY important, or you will burn your roux!</span>
      Continue
      to stir for approx 10-20 mins depending on the heat/thickness of the pot, monitoring color and making sure the
      flour doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot. During this process, turn the heat down as you stir until you get to
      a medium heat.</p>
    <p>All the while you're cooking the roux, you should be watching it <b>like a hawk.</b> This is about the color that
      the roux should be:</p>
    <div class="gumbo-color"></div>
    <p><b class="warning">IMPORTANT!</b></p>
    <p>I was told very shortly after making this, potentially ruining the first gumbo made off of this recipe that the
      color could display incorrectly depending on devices. Very, very cursed, I know. I suggest turning your phone
      brightness
      up to 100% and start with a slight shade lighter than what you see, just for safety. The good thing is, you'll
      know <b>for sure</b> if you burned it. </p>
    <p>well, for what it's worth, if you go <i>slightly past</i> (and I mean <i>slightly</i>) this color, it is okay,
      but you will really be pushing it. You're dancing with devilish temptation that could put you about a half hour to
      hour and a half behind. Your nose will tell you very quickly if you tripped during this dance. I highly suggest
      finding a YouTube video on roux specifically - <a href="https://youtu.be/mjwiw0oBUG8">i like this one
        personally.</a> I differ in her method in that I just use the stockpot straight up (which is stainless) and just
      use a wooden spatula or spoon to stir. The important bits are there though: her color is <b>on point</b> and her
      technique is great too.</p>
    <p>Turn heat down to medium-low heat and add onion, celery, 1 diced clove of garlic and bell pepper medley to the
      cooked roux. Stir vegetables and make sure they are completely covered with roux and let cook for a few minutes.
    </p>

      <h3>secret shortcut to the beers</h3>
      <p>If you don't want to do the chicken searing part, no sweat. You can just throw the chicken straight in or just
        carve up your typical rotisserie chicken from your local grocery and toss that in there. I suggest simple
        seasonings; lemon pepper didn't really work out too well in a pinch one time. It kind of worked, but the lemon
        tang
        didn't really compliment anything.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>before the beers</h3>
    <p>While these are cooking, get a pan hot enough to sear the chicken breasts/thighs. A well-oiled cast iron skillet
      works well for this. This is also optional, but might as well go all out if you can. Sear each
      side for about a minute and a half and then place in the pot.</p>
    <p>Finally, add the chicken stock, sausage, and diced jalapeno. Stir this together, adding about a quart of water to
      the mixture. Bring all of this to a nice rolling boil. If you have that glass of white wine, now is the
      time to toss that in (and I mean a typical, 6oz pour. Get that bottle sized glass outta here.). Shortly after it
      gets
      rolling, simmer for at least 3 hours, can be as long as 5 or 6.</p>
    <h3>during the beers, 45 mins before serving</h3>
    <p>Finely chop the parsley and cut the green onions into small little ringlets. Add the parsley and green onion to
      the simmering gumbo for the final touch and let cook for another 30-45 minutes. This would also be a great time
      add the file if you have it and to start some rice to go with this gumbo.</p>
    <h3>after the beers/gorging</h3>
    <p>If you'd like to serve this fancy, I suggest getting a <a href="https://imgur.com/OXHuDIn">soup bowl</a> and a <a
        href="https://imgur.com/fj3jLbt">smaller round bowl</a> that would fit in the middle of the soup bowl. Pack the
      rice into the
      smaller bowl and flip upside down onto the soup bowl. Remove the smaller bowl to reveal a little rice dome similar
      to what you'd find in a fancy restaurant down here. Ladle some gumbo around the fancy rice dome and top the rice
      with a small leaf of parsley for garnish.</p>
    <p>Any leftovers will guaranteed taste better the next day, so if you really wanna be "that guy," you can just do
      all of this and then throw the pot in the fridge after it's cooled and bring it back to a boil while the rice
      cooks the next day. Some restaurants down here only serve the "next day" gumbo for that reason. However, this
      should prove to be flavorful enough if you're pinched for time. If you want to be real extra, you can same day
      cool it in an ice bath like in that video from earlier.</p>
    <h3>vegan alternatives</h3>
    <p>Not super about the meats here? No worries! I've made a vegetarian/vegan version of this that worked out well.
      You double the bell pepper, replace the chicken stock with vegetable stock, add a purple onion in long strips and
      keep the white onion diced, and use kale chunks as a substitute. I took a page out of the Disney gumbo and also
      use quinoa as a substitute for rice to add some nuttiness. Which, by the way <b>don't even waste your time with
        the Disney gumbo.</b> I could be angry about many things about that gumbo, like the lack of a proper roux or the
      tomatoes, but most importantly, a crockpot has no place making a gumbo. Also, meat alternatives don't really work
      out super well either since you end up cooking them down over a very long time, so go for variety/leafy and be
      sure to add any leafy things the same time you would the green onion and parsley.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this recipe! If you have any questions, just drop me a line and don't be afraid to try again
      with a roux if you think you burned it.</p>
