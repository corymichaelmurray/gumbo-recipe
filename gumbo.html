<h1>cory's <span>secret</span> socialist gumbo recipe</h1>
<p>go ahead fellow citizens of the boot, hate away, but i've heard nothing but the occasional clink of the bowl and a quiet inquiry about seconds after i've served this to some of my favorite people.</p>

<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
   <li> ~1/4 cup unbleached flower</li>
   <li> ~1/4 cup olive oil</li>
   <li> 2 boxes of chicken stock</li>
   <li> one large white onion</li>
   <li> 1 bell pepper of each color</li>
   <li> couple stalks green onion</li>
   <li> stalk of celery</li>
   <li> 2 cloves of garlic</li>
   <li> 1 jalepeno</li>
   <li> fresh parsley </li>
   <li> pack of andouille sausage (usually comes in a pack of 3)</li>
   <li> small pack of boneless chicken breast</li>
   <li> small pack of boneless chicken thigh</li>
</ul>

<h3>prep stuffs</h3>
<p>take chicken and lightly coat with cajun seasoning (tony's, slap ya mama, something like that.) cover/ziplock chicken and put in fridge. slice andouille into small circles and set aside.</p>

<h3>the most important part: the roux</h3>
<p>in a heavy stock pot, heat a small portion of the olive oil to medium-high heat. cook sausage in this oil and take sausage out, leaving just the oil and what the sausage left behind. add the rest of the oil and bring to heat. slowly add the flour, constantly stirring to evenly spread the flour. <span>constant stirring is very VERY important, or you will burn your roux!</span> continue to stir for approx 20-30 mins depending on the heat/thickness of the pot, monitoring color and making sure the flour doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.</p> 

<p>after this time, you will start watching your roux <b>like a hawk.</b> this is the color that the roux should be:</p>

<p>if you go <i>slightly past</i> this color, it is okay, but you will really be pushing it. you're dancing with devilish temptation that could put you about a half hour to hour and a half behind. your nose will tell you very quickly if you tripped during this dance.</p>

<p>add vegetable stock and jalepeno, simmer for 4 hours.</p>
