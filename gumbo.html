<h1>cory's <span class="secret">secret socialist</span> gumbo recipe</h1>
</div>
<p>go ahead fellow citizens of the boot, hate away, but i've heard nothing but the occasional clink of the bowl and a quiet inquiry about second servings after i've served this to some of my favorite people. if you want this to be primo perfect flavor, you'll want to set aside at least 8 hours total to prep proper and really be set up for success. </p>
<p>why call it secret socialist gumbo? well, that's the theme for 2020, right? call things what they're not just to make people mad? too much edge for a recipe? no worries, it's mainly just a jab at family who think my borderline zealotry for education makes me a socialist. if anything, it's a great excuse to drink a beer or 6 and stir something while you watch the impending apocolypse through your kitchen window.</p>
<p>for the record: <b>all of these are approximate measurements!</b> feel free to tweak this after the first make, and please be sure to tell me about every time you do! this can definitely be better but i know for a <b>fact</b> this is a great place to start.</p>

<h3>ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li> ~1/4 cup unbleached flower</li>
  <li> ~1/4 cup olive oil</li>
  <li> 2 boxes of chicken stock (what you normally find in a grocery store)</li>
  <li> one large white onion</li>
  <li> 1 bell pepper of each color</li>
  <li> couple stalks green onion</li>
  <li> stalk of celery</li>
  <li> 2 cloves of garlic</li>
  <li> 1 jalepeno</li>
  <li> fresh parsley </li>
  <li> pack of andouille sausage (usually comes in a pack of 3)</li>
  <li> small pack of boneless chicken breast</li>
  <li> small pack of boneless chicken thigh</li>
</ul>
<h3>optional secret ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>glass of white wine if you have on hand</li>
  <li>2 tsp of file (dried and finely ground sassafras leaf)</li>
</ul>

<h3>prep stuffs</h3>
<p>this is usually done best the night before so you're not completely over cooking by the time you <i>actually</i> start prepping.</p>
<p>take chicken and lightly coat with cajun seasoning (tony's, slap ya mama, something like that.) cover/ziplock chicken and put in fridge. slice andouille into small circles and set aside. cube all the vegetables and dice the jalepeno and set aside.</p>

<h3>the most important part: the roux</h3>
<p>in a heavy stock pot, heat a small portion of the olive oil to medium-high heat. cook sausage in this oil and take sausage out, leaving just the oil and what the sausage left behind. add the rest of the oil and bring to heat. slowly add the flour, constantly stirring to evenly spread the flour throughout the oil. <span class="important">constant stirring is very VERY important, or you will burn your roux!</span> continue to stir for approx 20-30 mins depending on the heat/thickness of the pot, monitoring color and making sure the flour doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.</p> 

<p>after this time, you will start watching your roux <b>like a hawk.</b> this is the color that the roux should be:</p>
<div class="gumbo-color"></div>
<p>if you go <i>slightly past</i> (and i mean <i>slightly</i>) this color, it is okay, but you will really be pushing it. you're dancing with devilish temptation that could put you about a half hour to hour and a half behind. your nose will tell you very quickly if you tripped during this dance.</p>

<p>turn heat down to medium-low heat and add onion, celery, 1 diced clove of garlic and bell pepper medley. stir vegitables and make sure they are completely covered with roux and let cook for a few minutes.</p>

<h3>secret shortcut to the beers</h3>

<div class="secret">
  <p>if you don't want to do the chicken searing part, no sweat. you can just throw the chicken straignt in or just carve up your typical rotissere chicken from your local grocery and toss that in there. i suggest simple seasonings; lemon pepper didn't really work out too well in a pinch once time. it worked, but the lemon tang didn't really compliment anything.</p>
</div>

<h3>before the beers</h3>

<p>while these are cooking, get a pan hot enough to sear the chicken breasts/thighs. a well-oiled cast iron skillet works well for this. this is also optional, but if you were to do this, this is when you could do it. sear each side for about a minute and a half and then place in the pot.</p>

<p>finally, add the chicken stock, sausage, and diced jalepeno. if you have that glass of white wine, now is the time to toss that in (and i mean a typical, 6oz pour. get that bottle sized glass outta here.). once it gets rolled on simmer for at least 3 hours, can be as long as 5 or 6.</p>

<h3>during the beers, 45 mins before serving</h3>

<p>finely chop the parsley and cut the green onions into small little ringlets. add the parsley and green onion to the simmering gumbo for the final touch and let cook for another 30-45 minutes. this would also be a great time to start some rice to go with this gumbo at this point.</p>

<p>if you'd like to serve this fancy, i suggest getting a soup bowl and a smaller round bowl. pack the rice into the smaller bowl and flip upside down onto the soup bowl. remove the smaller bowl to reveal a little rice dome similar to what you'd find in a fancy restaurant down here. ladel some gumbo around the fancy rice dome and top the rice with a small leaf of parsley for garnish.</p>

<h3>after the beers/gorging</h3>
<p>any leftovers will guaranteed taste better the next day, so if you really wanna be "that guy," you can just do all of this and then throw the pot in the fridge after it's cooled and bring it back to a boil while the rice cooks the next day. some restaurants down here only serve the "next day" gumbo for that reason. however, this should prove to be flavorful enough if you're pinched for time.</p>

<h3>vegan alternatives</h3>
<p>not super about the meats here? no worries! i've made a vegetarian/vegan version of this that worked out well. you double the bell pepper, replace the chicken stock with vegetable stock, add a purple onion in long strips and keep the white onion diced, and use kale chunks as a substitute. i took a page out of the disney gumbo and also use quinoa as a substitute for rice to add some nuttiness. which, by the way <b>don't even waste your time with the disney gumbo.</b> i could be angry about many things about that gumbo, like the lack of a proper roux or the tomatoes, but most importantly, a crockpot has no place making a gumbo. also, meat alternatives don't really work out super well either since you end up cooking them down over a very long time.</p>

<p>i hope you enjoy this recipe! if you have any questions, just drop me a line and don't be afraid to try again with a roux if you think you burned it.</p>
